//function knapsack (vector of item objects, max weight)

// make a dp array with [i][j] where i is the object number and j is the max value
// for each [i][j] we should store the max value achived and the i's included


//recursive thinking version

// from startIndexCurrentmaxvalue_get_itemlist_maxvalue_maxweight:
//
//
// we either neex to take or skip
//
// take the item at cur index recurse()
//
//
// skip the item at cur index








//main function

// in the main function

// first read in the weight int using c functions btw

// next we have  lines of item-name;item-weight;item-value

// i want to make a vector of like item objects which has this info

// for now lets just read in the items and thats it.
